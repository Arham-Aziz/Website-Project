    <h1>About India</h1>
    <h2 class="title1">History</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="about1">
      India's social, economic, and cultural configurations are the products of
      a long process of regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth
      of the Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two
      phases are usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age. Hinduism
      arose in the Vedic period.

    <p class="about2">
      Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines
      native to India. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic
      groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally
      available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also
      heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural
      choices and traditions.

    <h2 class="title3">Sports</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="about3">
      Cricket is the most popular spectator sport in the country, and citizens
      often play it as a recreational activity; it generates the highest
      television viewership. However, in more recent decades, football has also
      become another popular sport in terms of broadcast viewership and stadium
      audience attendance. Kabaddi has grown into the mainstream, and so have
      badminton, tennis and athletics.
